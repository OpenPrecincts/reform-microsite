pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Alaska was subject to Section 5 of the Voting
  Rights Act because of a history of discrimination against minority groups. In accordance
  with Section 5, Alaska was required to receive preapproval from either the Department
  of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting plans. This decade
  will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers should closely monitor
  every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all Alaskans are treated
  fairly.

process: "Alaska's state legislative district lines are drawn by the state's Redistricting\
  \ Board, an independent commission with members appointed by the governor, the majority\
  \ leaders in each chamber of the legislature, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme\
  \ Court. It has only one at-large congressional district.\r\n\r\nIn addition to\
  \ the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Alaska\
  \ law requires that state legislative districts be compact, contiguous, preserve\
  \ political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest."
