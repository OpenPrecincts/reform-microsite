issues: "The Voting Rights Act and the Constitution currently guarantee that minority\
  \ populations should have fair opportunities to elect representatives. But when\
  \ blacks are packed to be 50% or more of the voting-eligible population of a district,\
  \ they may miss opportunities in neighboring districts. Fair districting therefore\
  \ requires careful attention to how the lines are drawn. Some of Alabama's maps\
  \ this past decade were found by federal courts to be racial gerrymanders. There\
  \ may be another attempt to commit racial gerrymanders in the upcoming redistricting\
  \  cycle.\r\n\r\nBecause a single party will control redistricting, there is an\
  \ increased risk of partisan gerrymandering."

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Alabama was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Alabama was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Alabamans are treated fairly.

process: "Alabama's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn by\
  \ the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The\
  \ legislature can override vetoes with a simple majority vote in each chamber.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Alabama law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest."
