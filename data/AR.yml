issues: Arkansas currently has single-party control over redistricting. A constitutional
  amendment could replace process with commission. There are two proposals. One proposal,
  sponsored by Little Rock attorney David Couch, will <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2018/10/26/attorney-general-approves-proposal-for-independent-redistricting-commission">establish</a>
  an independent citizens' redistricting commission. Passage of this proposal would
  change the redistricting process for 2021.

legislative_control: Republican
name: Arkansas
pitfalls: A different ballot initiative would also create a commission. However, the
  members would be appointed by politicians. This commission would likely have 5 Republicans
  and 2 Democrats. This measure is sponsored by politician Nate Steel.

process: "Arkansas's state legislative districts are drawn by an Apportionment Board\
  \ consisting of the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State.\
  \ Its Congressional districts are drawn by the legislature by ordinary statute,\
  \ and are subject to the governor's veto. The Legislature has the power to override\
  \ the Governor's veto with a simple majority in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Arkansas law requires that state legislative districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve communities of interest, and preserve the cores of prior districts. There\
  \ are no state law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
