issues: Arizona's Congressional maps do not score highly on the Princeton Gerrymandering
  Project's tests of partisan unfairness. Potential issues are a lack of representation
  for Native Americans and Latinos, as well as communities of interest.

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Arizona was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Arizona was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Arizonans are treated fairly.

process: "Arizona's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn by\
  \ the state's Independent Redistricting Commission.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal\
  \ requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Arizona law requires\
  \ that state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, preserve\
  \ political subdivisions, preserve communities of interest, and be drawn to promote\
  \ competitiveness. Consideration of partisan data is prohibited except where required\
  \ by federal law, as is favoring or disfavoring an incumbent or candidate for office."
