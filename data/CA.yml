process: "California's state legislative and congressional maps are drawn by an Independent\
  \ Commission of citizens, selected through a rigorous process to reduce partisan\
  \ influences.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one\
  \ vote and the Voting Rights Act, California law requires that state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions,\
  \ and preserve communities of interest. Consideration of partisan data is prohibited\
  \ except where required by federal law, as is favoring or disfavoring an incumbent,\
  \ candidate for office, or political party."
