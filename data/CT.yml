issues: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by Democrats.
  If the party has supermajorities in the legislature when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Connecticut's legislature has the primary responsibility of drawing state\
  \ legislative and congressional district lines. A supermajority of two-thirds of\
  \ each chamber is required to adopt a district plan. If the legislature fails to\
  \ adopt a plan for any chamber, the lines will be drawn by a nine-member backup\
  \ Commission.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one\
  \ vote and the Voting Rights Act, Connecticut law requires that state legislative\
  \ districts be contiguous and preserve political subdivisions. There are no state\
  \ law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
