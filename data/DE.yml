legislative_control: Democratic
name: Delaware
pitfalls: Both chambers of the Legislature and the Governorship are controlled by
  Democrats. If the party maintains control when it is time to draw new maps, there
  will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Delaware's legislative lines are drawn by the legislature by ordinary statute,\
  \ and are subject to the governor's veto. The Legislature can override vetoes with\
  \ a three-fifths majority in each chamber. It has only one at-large congressional\
  \ district.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote\
  \ and the Voting Rights Act, Delaware law requires that state legislative and congressional\
  \ districts be contiguous. Unduly favoring or disfavoring a person or party is prohibited."
