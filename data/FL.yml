issues: "The Voting Rights Act and the Constitution currently guarantee that minority\
  \ populations should have fair opportunities to elect representatives. But when\
  \ a community is packed to be 50% or more of the voting-eligible population of a\
  \ district, it may miss opportunities in neighboring districts. Fair districting\
  \ therefore requires careful attention to how the lines are drawn.\r\n\r\nDespite\
  \ constitutional prohibitions, every branch of Florida's government is controlled\
  \ by a single party. If that control persists into 2021, there will be an increased\
  \ risk of partisan and racial gerrymandering. Although the state Supreme Court intervened\
  \ to undo gerrymanders in the 2010s, a repeat of that may not occur because the\
  \ court has taken a strong rightward turn."

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Florida was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Florida was required to receive pre-approval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Floridians are treated fairly.

process: "Florida's congressional district lines are drawn by the legislature by ordinary\
  \ statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override\
  \ vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. Florida's state legislative lines\
  \ are drawn by the legislature by joint resolution, which are not subject to the\
  \ governor's veto. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person,\
  \ one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Florida law requires that state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts be compact, contiguous,  and preserve political subdivisions.\
  \ Intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent or political party is prohibited."
