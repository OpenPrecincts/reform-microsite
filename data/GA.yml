issues: "Georgia poses a challenge for advocates of fair districting. Both chambers\
  \ of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by Republicans, an there\
  \ is no initiative process.\r\n\r\nIf the party retains this control when it is\
  \ time to draw new maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan and racial\
  \ gerrymandering."

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Georgia was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Georgia was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Georgians are treated fairly.

process: "Georgia's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn by\
  \ the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The\
  \ legislature can override vetos with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\n\
  In addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights\
  \ Act, Georgia law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be\
  \ compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest."
