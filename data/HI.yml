process: "Hawai'i has a partisan redistricting commission. Software may be available\
  \ to submit plans, as it was in the previous cycle. Note that free software is being\
  \ developed nationally.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person,\
  \ one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Hawaii law requires that state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve communities of\
  \ interest. Unduly favoring or disfavoring an a person or party is prohibited."
