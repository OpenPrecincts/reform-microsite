process: "Iowa has one of the nation's first redistricting commission processes. \
  \ Civil servants, guided by a bipartisan committee, draft up to three maps, which\
  \ the legislature can accept or reject (or modify, after a certain number of rejections).\
  \ The success of this process depends on courtesy between legislators and a respect\
  \ for democratic norms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person,\
  \ one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Iowa law requires that state legislative and\
  \ congressional districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions.\
  \ Consideration of partisan data is prohibited except where required by federal\
  \ law, as is intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent, person, or group."
