process: "Idaho's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by an independent\
  \ redistricting commission which is evenly balanced between the two major parties.\
  \ The Commission holds public meetings throughout the state while considering plans,\
  \ and welcomes public input on how to draw districts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the\
  \ federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Idaho\
  \ law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest. Protecting\
  \ a party or incumbent is prohibited."
