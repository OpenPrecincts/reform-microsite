issues: "- Illinois has multiple opportunity-to-elect districts, drawn under the guidance\
  \ of the Voting Rights Act and the Constituion. Overall, Illinois does not set off\
  \ statistical alarms for partisan gerrymandering.\r\n\r\n- Illinois has a voter\
  \ initiative process. Such a process would reduce the risk of self-dealing by legislators."

legislative_control: Democratic
name: Illinois
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Democrats. If the party has control of the legislature when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Illinois's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the Governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a three-fifths vote in each chamber.\
  \ If the state fails to adopt legislative lines, a backup commission is formed to\
  \ draw those lines. There is no backup commission in the event of a failure to adopt\
  \ congressional district lines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of\
  \ one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Illinois law requires that state\
  \ legislative districts be compact and contiguous. There are no state law requirements\
  \ for drawing congressional districts."
