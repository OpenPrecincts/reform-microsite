name: Indiana
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Republicans. If the party maintains those majorities when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Indiana's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a simple majority in each chamber. If\
  \ the state fails to adopt congressional districts, a backup commission is formed\
  \ to draw them. There is no backup commission in the event of a failure to adopt\
  \ legislative district lines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of\
  \ one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Indiana law requires that state\
  \ legislative districts be contiguous. There are no state law requirements for drawing\
  \ congressional districts."
