issues: The GOP-controlled legislature currently has a supermajority in both House
  and Senate, enough to override the governor's veto on a redistricting plan. A change
  of two seats in House or Senate would undo the supermajority.

process: "Kansas's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Kansas law requires that state legislative districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, preserve communities of interest, and avoid pairing\
  \ incumbents. Kansas law requires that the state's congressional districts be compact,\
  \ contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, preserve communities of interest,\
  \ and preserve the cores of prior districts."
