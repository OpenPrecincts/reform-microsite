actions: In 2019, elect gubernatorial candidates who support redistricting reform.
  The entire state legislature is up for re-election in 2020 as well. A majority-reform
  coalition or split control of state power could check the worst gerrymandering impulses
  in 2021.

issues: "Kentucky presents a challenging case for advocates of fair districting. There\
  \ is no public comment process, and redistricting is under single-party control.\r\
  \n\r\nThe governorship is up for election in November 2019. The incumbent, Matt\
  \ Bevin (R), has the lowest approval rating of all governors nationwide. But even\
  \ if a Democrat wins, Republicans will be able to override a veto to a redistricting\
  \ plan by a simple majority vote."

process: "Kentucky's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a simple majority vote in each chamber.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Kentucky law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be contiguous and preserve political subdivisions. Additionally, the state's congressional\
  \ districts must also preserve communities of interest."
