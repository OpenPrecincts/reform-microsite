  \n\r\n- The 2019 gubernatorial election will determine whether 2021 redistricting\
  \ will occur under single-party or split-party control.\r\n\r\n- In 2021, use public\
  \ comment to identify communities of interest. Use open data and free software to\
  \ analyze draft maps for undue partisanship or ill treatment of minority groups.\r\
  \n\r\n- After redistricting in 2021, be aware of the risk of racial gerrymandering\
  \ - and a federal lawsuit."

issues: "In 2019, Democratic governor John Bel Edwards is up for re-election. If he\
  \ is re-elected, both parties will have a say in redistricting.\r\n\r\nThe Voting\
  \ Rights Act and the Constitution currently guarantee that minority populations\
  \ should have fair opportunities to elect representatives. But when blacks are packed\
  \ to be 50% or more of the voting-eligible population of a district, they may miss\
  \ opportunities in neighboring districts. Fair districting therefore requires careful\
  \ attention to how the lines are drawn."

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Louisiana was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Louisiana was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Louisianans are treated fairly.

process: "Louisiana's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Louisiana law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve the cores of prior\
  \ districts."
