issues: "Redistricting in Massachusetts is under single-party control by Democrats\
  \ because of the party's  legislative supermajorities (permitting override of a\
  \ veto from the Commonwealth's Republican governor), and the delegation is 9 Democrats\
  \ and no Republicans. However, the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group has\
  \ used intensive computer simulations to find that Republicans are so evenly distributed\
  \ around the state that drawing a Republican Congressional district is impossible.\r\
  \n\r\nMassachusetts has an extensive <a href=\"http://redistricting.lls.edu/states-MA.php#input\"\
  >public input</a> process for redistricting."

process: "Massachusetts's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn\
  \ by the state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's\
  \ veto. The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Massachusetts law requires that state legislative and congressional\
  \ districts be contiguous and preserve political subdivisions. There are no state\
  \ law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
