issues: "In 2011, Maryland Democrats drew a congressional gerrymander to take the\
  \ Sixth Congressional District from Republicans. This was the subject of a high-profile\
  \ test case before the Supreme Court, Benisek v. Lamone.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, redistricting\
  \ will be done under split-party control. There will be no elections between now\
  \ and redistricting. Democrats have legislative supermajorities, opening the possibility\
  \ that they could override of a veto by Republican governor Larry Hogan. However,\
  \ a switch of four Senate votes or fifteen votes in the House of Delegates would\
  \ bring Democrats below supermajority threshold."

process: "Maryland's state legislative districts are drawn by the governor. If the\
  \ state legislature fails to adopt its own plans within 45 days of the release of\
  \ the governor's maps, the governor's maps are adopted. If the legislature adopts\
  \ its own maps, they are not subject to the governor's veto.\r\n\r\nMaryland's congressional\
  \ districts are drawn by the state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject\
  \ to the governor's veto. The legislature can override vetoes with a three-fifths\
  \ vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person,\
  \ one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Maryland law requires that state legislative\
  \ districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions. There are\
  \ no state law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
