process: "Maine has an advisory commission that makes recommendations to the legislature,\
  \ which can accept, modify, or reject the recommendations. Any map it adopts must\
  \ be by a two-thirds vote in each chamber of the legislature.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Maine law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact,\
  \ contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions."
