process: "Beginning in the 2020 redistricting cycle, Michigan's state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts will be drawn by an independent redistricting commission.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Michigan law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest. Intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent, candidate, or\
  \ party is prohibited. Additionally, state law requires that state legislative districts\
  \ be drawn to preserve the prior cores of preexisting districts."
