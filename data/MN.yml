process: "Minnesota's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Minnesota law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest. For state legislative districts only, intentionally favoring or disfavoring\
  \ an incumbent is prohibited."
