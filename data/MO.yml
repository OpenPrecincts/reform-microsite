process: "Beginning in 2021, Missouri's state legislative districts will be drawn\
  \ by a nonpartisan state demographer. The demographer will draft maps for the legislature,\
  \ which can either approve or reject them. The state's congressional districts will\
  \ be drawn by the legislature by ordinary statute, and will be subject to the governor's\
  \ veto.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and\
  \ the Voting Rights Act, Missouri law requires that state legislative  districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and be drawn to promote\
  \ partisan symmetry. Missouri law requires that congressional districts be compact\
  \ and contiguous. For state legislative districts only, intentionally favoring or\
  \ disfavoring an incumbent, party, or candidate for office is prohibited."
