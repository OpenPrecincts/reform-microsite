pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Mississippi was subject to Section 5 of
  the Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Mississippi was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Mississippians are treated fairly.

process: "Mississippi's state legislative and congressional lines are drawn by the\
  \ legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature\
  \ can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. If the legislature\
  \ fails to adopt a state legislative map, the task falls to a partisan backup commission\
  \ currently controlled by Republicans.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements\
  \ of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Mississippi law requires that\
  \ state legislative l districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions.\
  \ Mississippi law requires that congressional districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest."
