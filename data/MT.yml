process: "Montana's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by an\
  \ independent redistricting commission. Currently, Montana has only one at-large\
  \ congressional district. If Montana gains a second district following the 2020\
  \ Census, its congressional districts will also be drawn by the commission.\r\n\r\
  \nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Montana law requires that state legislative districts be compact,\
  \ contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions. Consideration of partisan data\
  \ is prohibited except where required by federal law or as a remedy in a lawsuit,\
  \ as is favoring or disfavoring a party or or candidate for office."
