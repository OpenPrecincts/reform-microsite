issues: "North Carolina is one of the most extremely gerrymandered states in the nation.\
  \ Although current Congressional and legislative maps have been redrawn as a result\
  \ of federal racial-gerrymandering lawsuits, a strong pro-Republican bias remains.\
  \ Before 2010, the Congressional map had a strong pro-Democratic bias.\r\n\r\nA\
  \ Supreme Court decision (<a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/06/opinion-analysis-no-role-for-courts-in-partisan-gerrymandering/\"\
  ><i>Rucho v. Common Cause</i></a>) left the current Congressional map in place and\
  \ set a precedent against federal intervention in partisan gerrymandering. A case\
  \ in state court (<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/common-cause-v-lewis\"\
  ><i>Common Cause v. Lewis</i></a>), concerning state legislative districts, is now\
  \ going to trial. The state Supreme Court is partisan and leans Democratic.\r\n\r\
  \nIn the N.C. General Assembly, five different bills have been introduced to change\
  \ the redistricting process. Two of these, HB 69 and HB 648, would set up an independent\
  \ commission, public hearings, and prohibit partisan bias in maps."

process: "North Carolina's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn\
  \ by the state legislature by ordinary statute. Unlike most states, the resulting\
  \ plans are not subject to the governor's veto.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal\
  \ requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, North Carolina\
  \ law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest. Using racial\
  \ data is prohibited."
