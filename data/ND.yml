  \ of fair representation under the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.\r\n\r\
  \nNorth Dakota has a ballot initiative process.\r\n\r\nThe governorship is up for\
  \ election in November 2020. A Republican win will lead to continued single-party\
  \ control over redistricting. A Democratic win will lead to bipartisan control."

legislative_control: Republican
name: North Dakota
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Republicans. If the party maintains those majorities when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "North Dakota's state legislative lines are drawn by the legislature by ordinary\
  \ statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override\
  \ vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. It has only one at-large congressional\
  \ district.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote\
  \ and the Voting Rights Act, North Dakota law requires that state legislative districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve the cores\
  \ of prior districts."
