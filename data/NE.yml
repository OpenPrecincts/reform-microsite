process: "Nebraska has a one-chamber legislature that is nominally nonpartisan, but\
  \ is in fact Republican. Its state legislative and congressional districts are drawn\
  \ by the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a three-fifths vote in each chamber.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Nebraska law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve the cores\
  \ of prior districts. There are separate prohibitions for state legislative and\
  \ congressional districts. State law prohibits state legislative districts from\
  \ being drawn with the aid of partisan data, or to intentionally favor a party,\
  \ group, or person. Meanwhile, state law prohibits congressional districts from\
  \ being drawn with the aid of partisan data or to protect incumbents."
