pitfalls: Governor Chris Sununu vetoed a bipartisan reform bill with overwhelming

process: "New Hampshire's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn\
  \ by the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, New Hampshire law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous\
  \ and preserve political subdivisions. There are no state law requirements for drawing\
  \ congressional districts."
