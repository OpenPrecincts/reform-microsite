process: "New Jersey's state legislative congressional districts are drawn by two\
  \ different partisan commissions comprised of politicians. Each commission has equal\
  \ numbers of Democrats and Republicans, with a tie-breaking chair selected by the\
  \ other commissioners.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person,\
  \ one vote and the Voting Rights Act, New Jersey law requires that state legislative\
  \ districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions. There are\
  \ no state law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
