name: New Mexico
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by

  there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "New Mexico's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by\
  \ the state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, New Mexico law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest."
