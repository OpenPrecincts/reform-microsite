process: "Nevada's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature\
  \ can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Nevada law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact,\
  \ contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, preserve communities of interest,\
  \ and avoid pairing incumbents."
