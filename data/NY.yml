process: "Beginning in 2021, New York's state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ will be drawn by a ten-member commission, which will submit proposed plans to\
  \ the state legislature for an up-or-down vote. Only after the commission rejects\
  \ two proposed maps will the legislature be permitted to make amendments to the\
  \ commission's proposals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one\
  \ person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, New York law requires that state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions,\
  \ preserve communities of interest, preserve the cores of prior districts, and be\
  \ drawn to promote competitiveness. Intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent,\
  \ party, or candidate for office is prohibited."
