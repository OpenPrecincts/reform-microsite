process: "Beginning in 2021, Ohio will use two unique systems to draw its state legislative\
  \ and congressional districts. For congressional districts, the legislature must\
  \ attempt to pass redistricting plans that attract support from both parties. If\
  \ this fails, then the task goes to a commission whose members are appointed by\
  \ politicians. If that fails, then the task goes back to the legislature. If there\
  \ is still a lack of bipartisan support, the resulting plan will go into effect\
  \ for only four years, after which the process will begin again. For state legislative\
  \ districts, the same commission that serves as a backup for drawing congressional\
  \ districts has the primary responsibility for drawing state legislative maps. The\
  \ length of time for which the maps are in effect depends on the breakdown for how\
  \ they are adopted: if at least two commissioners aligned with both parties vote\
  \ for the maps, they remain in effect for the entire decade. But if the maps are\
  \ adopted on a party-line vote, they will only be in effect for four years.\r\n\r\
  \nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Ohio law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions. Favoring an incumbent\
  \ or party is prohibited."
