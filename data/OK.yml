legislative_control: Republican
name: Oklahoma
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Republicans. If the party maintains those majorities when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Oklahoma's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn\
  \ by the state legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's\
  \ veto. The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\
  \n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, Oklahoma law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest."
