legislative_control: Democratic
name: Oregon
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Democrats. If the party maintains those majorities when it is time to draw new maps
  and no process reforms have been adopted, there will be an increased risk of partisan
  gerrymandering.

process: "Oregon's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn by\
  \ the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The\
  \ legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\n\
  In addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights\
  \ Act, Oregon law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be\
  \ contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest.\
  \ Intentionally favoring an incumbent, party, or candidate for office is prohibited."
