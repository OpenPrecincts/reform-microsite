issues: "In 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the Congressional map\
  \ was an illegal partisan gerrymander, based on the \"free and fair elections\"\
  \ clause of its state constitution. This undid one of the most extreme gerrymanders\
  \ in the nation.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, both Congressional and legislative line-drawing\
  \ will be under the control of both major parties."

process: "Pennsylvania's congressional lines are drawn by the state legislature by\
  \ ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can\
  \ override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania's\
  \ state legislative lines are drawn by a commission of politicians.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Pennsylvania law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be\
  \ compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions."
