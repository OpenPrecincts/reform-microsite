process: "Responsibility for drawing Rhode Island's state legislative and congressional\
  \ districts lies with the state legislature, which may adopt plans by ordinary statute.\
  \ Those plans are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override vetoes\
  \ with a three-fifths vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Rhode Island established\
  \ an advisory commission that makes recommendations to the legislature, which it\
  \ can accept, modify, or reject entirely.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements\
  \ of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Rhode Island law requires that\
  \ state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve\
  \ political subdivisions."
