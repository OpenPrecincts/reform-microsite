issues: The Voting Rights Act and the Constitution currently guarantee that minority
  populations should have fair opportunities to elect representatives. But when blacks
  are packed to be 50% or more of the voting-eligible population of a district, they
  may miss opportunities in neighboring districts. Fair districting therefore requires
  careful attention to how the lines are drawn.

name: South Carolina
pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, South Carolina was subject to Section 5
  of the Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, South Carolina was required to receive pre-approval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  South Carolinians are treated fairly.

process: "South Carolina's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn\
  \ by the legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto.\
  \ The legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\
  \r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting\
  \ Rights Act, South Carolina law requires that state legislative and congressional\
  \ districts be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, preserve communities\
  \ of interest, preserve the cores of prior districts, and avoid pairing incumbents."
