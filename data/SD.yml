process: "North Dakota's state legislative lines are drawn by the legislature by ordinary\
  \ statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override\
  \ vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. It has only one at-large congressional\
  \ district.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote\
  \ and the Voting Rights Act, South Dakota law requires that state legislative districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities\
  \ of interest."
