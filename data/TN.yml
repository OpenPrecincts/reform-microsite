  \ showing either (a) what a fair map would look like, or (b) where the community\
  \ you believe should be better represented is located.\r\n\r\n- Submit these maps\

legislative_control: Republican
name: Tennessee
pitfalls: Both chambers of the legislature and the governorship are controlled by
  Republicans. If the party maintains those majorities when it is time to draw new
  maps, there will be an increased risk of partisan gerrymandering.

process: "Tennessee's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature\
  \ can override vetoes with a simple majority vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Tennessee law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and preserve\
  \ political subdivisions. There are no state law requirements for drawing congressional\
  \ districts."
