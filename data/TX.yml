  \n\r\n- After redistricting, be alert for racial gerrymandering lawsuits in federal\

issues: "- The Voting Rights Act and the Constitution currently guarantee that minority\
  \ populations should have fair opportunities to elect representatives. In Texas,\
  \ this is problematic: despite picking up five more House representatives in the\
  \ last two decades thanks to increases in the Hispanic population, no additional\
  \ Hispanic Congresspersons have been elected. The reason? Racial gerrymandering.\r\
  \n\r\n- The effort to add a citizenship question to the Census would open the possibility\
  \ of drawing districts of equal citizen population rather than equal total population.\
  \ This would allow Hispanics to be packed into even fewer districts. Racial gerrymandering\
  \ is also a significant risk in 2021."

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Texas was subject to Section 5 of the Voting
  Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority groups.
  In accordance with Section 5, Texas was required to receive preapproval from either
  the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Texans are treated fairly.

process: "Texas's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the legislature\
  \ by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can\
  \ override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition to\
  \ the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Texas\
  \ law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous. There are no state\
  \ law requirements for drawing congressional districts."
