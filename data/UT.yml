issues: In 2019, the state legislature attempted to repeal the new independent commission
  law adopted by voters in 2018. While it failed to do so, Utahns should be be prepared
  to defend the independent commission law once again when the legislature reconvenes
  in 2020.

process: "Beginning in 2021, Utah's state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ will be drawn by an independent redistricting commission. The commission will\
  \ submit its plans as proposals to the state legislature, which will be able to\
  \ either approve or reject them in an up-or-down vote.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the\
  \ federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Utah law\
  \ requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest. Intentionally\
  \ favoring or disfavoring an incumbent, party, or candidate for office is prohibited."
