  \r\n- A constitutional amendment to establish a redistricting commission has been\
  \ passed by the General Assembly (both House and Senate) in the most recent legislative\
  \ session. If it is passed again in the 2019-2020 legislative session, the question\

pitfalls: In recent redistricting cycles, Virginia was subject to Section 5 of the
  Voting Rights Act because of a history of racial discrimination against minority
  groups. In accordance with Section 5, Virginia was required to receive preapproval
  from either the Department of Justice or a federal court for any change to its redistricting
  plans. This decade will be the first cycle without those protections. Observers
  should closely monitor every step of the redistricting process to ensure that all
  Virginians are treated fairly.

process: "Virginia's state legislative and congressional districts are drawn by the\
  \ legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature\
  \ can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ Virginia law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact,\
  \ contiguous, and preserve communities of interest."
