process: "Responsibility for drawing Vermont's state legislative and congressional\
  \ districts lies with the state legislature, which may adopt plans by ordinary statute.\
  \ Those plans are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override vetoes\
  \ with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. It has only one at-large congressional\
  \ district.\r\n\r\nVermont statutes call for an advisory commission to make recommendations\
  \ to the legislature, which it can accept, modify, or reject entirely.\r\n\r\nIn\
  \ addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights\
  \ Act, Vermont law requires that state legislative districts be compact, contiguous,\
  \ preserve political subdivisions, and preserve communities of interest."
