  \ Wisconsin Assembly currently lacks a supermajority. Split-party control over redistricting\
  \ is possible in 2021 because of Democratic Governor Tony Evers.\r\n\r\n- State\
  \ legislative elections will take place in 2020."

process: "Wisconsin's state legislative and congressional lines are drawn by the legislature\
  \ via statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature can override\
  \ vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the federal\
  \ requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Wisconsin law\
  \ requires that state legislative districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve\
  \ political subdivisions. There are no state law requirements for congressional\
  \ districts."
