abbreviation: WV
actions: In 2019, elect legislative and gubernatorial candidates who support redistricting
  reform. The entire state legislature is up for re-election this year, as is the
  Governor. A majority-reform coalition or split control of state power could check
  the worst gerrymandering impulses in 2021. In 2021, use data and free software to
  weigh in on communities of interest, as well as analyze proposed maps.

issues: Beginning in 2021, West Virginia will redistrict its state legislature entirely
  with single-member districts instead of a mix of single-member and multi-member
  districts. This will increase the number of legislative districts, which in turn
  increases the number of opportunities for partisan offenses to be committed.

process: "West Virginia's state legislative and congressional district lines are drawn\
  \ by the legislature via statute, and are subject to the governor's veto. The legislature\
  \ can override vetoes with a simple majority vote in each chamber.\r\n\r\nIn addition\
  \ to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act,\
  \ West Virginia law requires that state legislative and congressional districts\
  \ be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions."
