- Use software tools such as [Dave's Redistricting App](https://davesredistricting.org) and [Districtr](https://districtr.org/) to draw district maps showing either (a) what a fair map would look like, or (b) where the community you believe should be better represented is located.</actions><actions_rendered>&lt;p&gt;In the post-2010 cycle, the principal avenue for fair districts in Florida was the state Supreme Court - and this route was partially successful in 2011. In 2021, the Court’s composition will be very different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of representation, an unfairly drawn plan can have three to six times the effect of even the worst Census undercount. Therefore additional steps are necessary to increase the likelihood of a plan that is responsive to voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme plans can favor one party or the other, or severely hinder the representation of racial and ethnic communities. One remedy is to make sure that public input is as effective as possible through data and technology (for instance, using public input tools such as Representable.org), so that legislators will have communities of interest easily available to them. To that end, a bill has been introduced (SB252) to expand public access to draft plans by revising a section of Florida’s public records law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another remedy is to achieve split-party control of government. Florida currently has single-party government under Republicans. In the 2020 election, this can be done in the 2020 election by changing 14 state House seats. The win margins in the 14 closest Republican-won seats in 2018 averaged about 2,100 votes. As a comparison, Amendment 4 potentially restores voting rights to 1.4 million Floridians - an average of 12,000 per House district. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concrete action is to support a ballot initiative to Florida's ballot to create an independent citizens' redistricting commission. This will prevent gerrymanders from being committed in the first place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, use public comment to identify communities of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</actions_rendered><process>Florida's congressional district lines are drawn by the Legislature by ordinary statute, and are subject to the Governor's veto. The Legislature can override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. Florida's state legislative lines are drawn by the Legislature by joint resolution, which are not subject to the Governor's veto. Within 15 days, these plans are sent to the state Supreme Court to ensure that they meet the state's redistricting standards. If they do not, the legislature gets a second chance to draw plans. If the state Supreme Court again finds that the plans are invalid, the Court will have 60 days to draw its own mapss. Final plans must be approved by the 2022 candidate filing deadline, which is 120 days before the 2022 primary.

In addition to the federal requirements of one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act, Florida law requires that state legislative and congressional districts be compact, contiguous, and preserve political subdivisions. Intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent or political party is prohibited.

While Florida law does not require public hearings, the state held such hearings between June 20 and August 31 in the 2011 cycle. Should hearings be held again in 2021, it will likely be on a similar schedule.

- In the 2020 session, no shortage of redistricting bills were introduced. Since the start of session, however, this list has dwindled to create two paths towards reform.

- The first path is to pass the constitutional amendment ([HJ71](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj71)/[SJ18](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj18)) and proposed enabling legislation ([HB758](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb758)/[SB203](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb203)).

- The second path is to pass a statutory alternative commission ([HB1256](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1256)) alongside a criteria bill ([HB1255](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1255)/[SB717](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb717)).

- All of these bills contain the same fairness criteria, including language mirroring the Voting Rights Act, protecting communities of interest, and prohibiting partisan advantage on the state-wide level. Additionally, they all have nearly identical commission structures, including conflict prevention,  commissioner diversity requirements, and public input requirements. The differences are that the first path's fallback is the state Supreme Court with two Special Masters, one chosen by a list provided by each party, while the second path relies on the General Assembly. The second path, on the other hand, has stronger diversity language and slightly improved public input requirements.</issues><issues_rendered>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constitutional amendment to establish a redistricting commission was passed by the General Assembly (both House and Senate) in the most recent legislative session.
